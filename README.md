An app to review your Claude Code conversations. These are typically stored at ~/.claude/projects in a JSON format. This electron app allows you to:

- view all conversations by chronological order (most recent first)
- filter by projects
- view all messages in a conversation
- allow individual messages to be deleted

This app is ideal for when Claude has hit an issue and you need to manually rewind (Claude doesn't always recover in these scenarios).
